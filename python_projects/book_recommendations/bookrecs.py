"""
Bookrecs.py
Takes given ratings.txt and given booklist.txt and matches the ratings for each person
with the books. Then sorts these entries by lastname first name, and then book title.
Then the program asks for input of which person, a different operator ('<, >, =') and
then an integerreferring to the ratings between -5 to 5. The program returns the
appropriate searched for criteria.

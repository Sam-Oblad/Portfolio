In this project, I created a working dessert shop to show how
classes, inheritance, and interfaces work. 

The main part of the project is the actual dessert shop.
We also added on a payroll module where I designed a uml diagram and then implemented it into python code. 

The dessert shop calculates prices, totals, taxes and it will organizes this into an order object and then stores the order in a list of a customer object which can be looked up in the admin module

The dessert shop runs only in a terminal and does not save any reciepts if the terminal quits the program. The payroll module takes multiple csv files and calculates paychecks based off of salary, hourly or commissioned employee types. Each employee object has a classification object of which type of pay the employee object is.
